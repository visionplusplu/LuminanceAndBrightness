# Luminance And Brightness
This repository contains the data and scripts required to process behavioural, EEG & DNN data, and to generate main and supplementary figures for the manuscript: An evaluation of the candela as the S.I. unit of luminous intensity.

## 1. System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Ubuntu (tested on Windows 10 or later, macOS Tahoe 26.1)
- **MATLAB Version:** R2020a or later
- **Required MATLAB Toolboxes:** Curve Fitting Toolbox (v3.6)
- **Hardware:** Standard desktop/laptop computer (no special hardware required)

## 2. Installation Guide

- Download the repository: 
  https://github.com/visionplusplu/LuminanceAndBrightness
  
- Or clone with git:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/visionplusplu/LuminanceAndBrightness.git
  ```
  
- Open MATLAB and set the repository root directory as your working directory.



## 3. Demo: Generate All Figures
To generate all figures and process the data as in the manuscript:
 1. Start MATLAB and navigate to the main project folder.
 2. Add the main project folder and its subfolders to the MATLAB path.
 3. Run the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:

main
All figures will be saved to the figs/ directory, and cleaned data files will be saved in the data/ directory.

Expected Output:

PDF and PNG files for all main and supplementary figures
Cleaned MATLAB data files (e.g., onlineData.mat)
Typical install & run times:

Setup: less than 1 minute (copy/unzip files and MATLAB path setup)
Data download: repository (with datasets) is > 6 GB (download time depends on your internet speed)
Expected run time: ~5–10 minutes on a standard computer
